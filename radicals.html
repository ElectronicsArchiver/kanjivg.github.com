  <h1>Radicals in KanjiVG</h1>
</div>

<p>
KanjiVG contains information on the kanji radical (部首) used by each
kanji. Since different authors use different radicals for the same
kanji, it provides several variants.
</p>

<h2>Radicals used</h2>

<p>
  This section details the choices made for the values of
  <a href="format.html#element"><code>kvg:element</code></a>, the visual
  representation of a kanji radical.
</p>

<section id="shin-nyo">
  <h3>
    Shin-nyō
  </h3>

<p>
  The radical used for Kangxi radical 162, "walk", known
  as <span class='romaji'>shin-nyō</span> in Japanese, is either
  U+8FB6 辶 for groups of four strokes, or U+2ECC ⻌ for groups of
  three strokes. (Depending on the font, U+8FB6 may appear to contain
  only three strokes.)
</p>

<p>
  The visually highly similar U+2ECD, from CJK Radicals Supplement,
  and U+FA66, from CJK Compatibility Ideographs, are not used by
  KanjiVG.
</p>

<section id="shoku-hen">

  <h3>
    Shoku-hen
  </h3>

  <p>
    For Kangxi radical 184, "eat", known
    as <span class='romaji'>shoku-hen</span> in Japanese, 飠 U+98E0
    from CJK Unified Ideographs is used for the eight-stroke variant,
    but ⻞ U+2EDE from CJK Radicals Supplement is used for the
    nine-stroke variant, since there does not seem to be a
    visually-close equivalent in the CJK Unified Ideographs.
  </p>

<h3>
  Other radicals
</h3>

<p>
  For all of the non-variant radical forms, there are two equivalent
  Unicode code points with the same visual form. One is in the Kangxi
  Radicals block of Unicode, from U+2F00 to U+2FD5, and the other is
  in the CJK Unified Ideograph block of Unicode. The equivalence
  between these is given in the Unicode Character Database (UCD) in
  the file
  <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/CJKRadicals.txt">CJKRadicals.txt</a>,
  which maps between the pairs.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    KanjiVG uses only the CJK Unified Ideograph versions of these
    equivalent entries.
  </strong>
  KanjiVG does not use the Kangxi Radicals block at all.
</p>

<p>
  However, KanjiVG does use some parts of the CJK Radicals Supplement
  block from U+2E80 to U+2EF3, for example U+2E97 ⺗ is used for
  the <span class='romaji'>shitagokoro</span> variant of Kangxi
  radical 61, rather than the CJK Unified Ideographs equivalent form
  U+38FA 㣺.
</p>

<p id="table-key">
  In the following table, <span style='used'>the pink colour</span>
  shows which variant was used for various radicals. The <b>number</b>
  field gives the Kangxi radical number, and the name is the romanised
  Japanese name of the radical.

This is used in two place in KanjiVG, one is kanji/072af.svg, but not
as a radical. It's also used as the radical for itself, U+353E. So
it's not really useful to add to this table. Software might need to
handle it, so I'm not sure what is best to do.

      "self-exception" for this character.

      The character U+961D is actually radical 170 rather than 163,
      but it may be substituted for radical 163 as well as for
      170. KanjiVG clearly distinguishes the two using U+2ECF for this
      radical.
