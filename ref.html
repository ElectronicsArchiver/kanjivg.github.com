<h2>References used by the KanjiVG creators</h2>

<p>
  The following references were used by the original KanjiVG authors to
  form the data.
</p>

<p>
  <i>DFKyoKaSho-W3-MP-RKSJ-H</i> by DynaLab and <i>A-OTF Kyoukasho ICA
    Pro L</i> by Morisawa and Company Limited were used as model fonts for
  KanjiVG.  The Morisawa font was used, for example, when the DynaLab
  font was lacking characters.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Hitsujun shidō no tebiki</i>, the official reference of the
  Ministry for Education (Monbushō), published by Hakubundō, Tokyo in
  1958, was used as reference for the stroke order of the Kyōiku Kanji.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Kaigyōsō – Hitsujun jitai jiten</i>, author EMORI, Kenji,
  published in 2003 by Sanseidō, Tokyo was used as reference for
  the <a href="glossary.html#kaisho">kaisho</a> characters.

    The JIS Kanji Jiten (JIS 漢字字典) is the kanji dictionary of the
    Japanese Standards Association. This kanji dictionary is regarded as
    authoritative on kanji radicals by Jim Breen, the author of Kanjidic,
    upon which KanjiVG was originally based, thus the radicals given in
    this reference are used in Kanjidic as the "traditional" radical,
    which sometimes diverge from the radical used by this project as
    <a href="svg-format.html#radical-general">general</a>
    or <a href="svg-format.html#radical-tradit">tradit</a>.
