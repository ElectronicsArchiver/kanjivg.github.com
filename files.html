  <h1>KanjiVG files</h1>
</div>

<p>
  KanjiVG is designed as an extension of SVG. All KanjiVG files are
  100% SVG-compliant and can be opened by any SVG viewer or editor
  as-is. The shape of each kanji stroke (an individual line) is
  described as an
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData">SVG path</a>
  on an area of size 109x109.
</p>

<p>
  The SVG file is organized in such a way that it reflects the
  structure and stroke order of the kanji.  Furthermore, several
  additional attributes are added in order to provide extra
  information about the kanji's structure.
</p>

<p class='undocumented'>
  Undocumented and unknown features, and notes on possible flaws in
  the data, are distinguished with a pale green background.
</p>

<h2>Character models</h2>

<p>
  The main graphical data is is based on schoolbook fonts
  (<nobr><ruby>教科書体<rt>きょうかしょたい</rt></ruby></nobr>), which
  is a variation of the calligraphic kaisho style 

  (<nobr><ruby>楷書<rt>かいしょ</rt></ruby></nobr>). 
</p>

<p>
  There is data for variations of characters and stroke order. When
  characters in schoolbook style deviate from traditional kaisho,
  there might be an extra version for kaisho, labelled with the
  suffix <code>-Kaisho</code>. There are also different versions for
  different stroke orders.
</p>

<h3>Variant suffixes</h3>

<p>
  The following is a complete list of the file suffixes used to
  indicate variant forms. Not all of them are known.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Hyougai</dt>
<dd>
Variant forms of the character, called "hyougai"

(<ruby>表外<rt>ひょうがい</rt></ruby>) in
Japanese. <span class='undocumented'>These are often the characters
for different Unicode code points, or otherwise inconsistent.
</span>

<dd>
<b>H</b>ori<b>z</b>ontal <b>F</b>ir<b>st</b> stroke order
</dd>
<dt>HzFstLeRi</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>HzLst</dt>

<dd>
Versions of the character used for names, which appear in the Jinmei

different Unicode code points than the ones given.</span>
</dd>

Kaisho variant. In practice this usually seems to mean something like
月 or 日 with a shorter middle stroke which doesn't go all the way to

<dd>
Left First
</dd>

</dd>
<dt>TenLst</dt>
<dd>
These characters all contain a 卵 element, with the centre right
shortest stroke coming last in the stroke order.
</dd>
<dt>Vt4</dt>
<dd>
These characters contain a variant stroke order with a vertical as the
fourth stroke.
</dd>
<dt>Vt6</dt>
<dd>
These characters contain a variant stroke order with a vertical as the
sixth stroke.
</dd>
<dt>VtFst</dt>
<dd>
