<h2 id="coverage">Coverage</h2>
<p>
  KanjiVG contains <a href="glossary.html#vector-graphics">vector
  graphics</a> which represent the Japanese versions of the Chinese
  characters (henceforth "kanji") and other characters of the Japanese
  JIS standard encodings known
  as <a href="glossary.html#jis-levels">"level one" and "level
  two"</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The vector graphics are based
  on <a href="glossary.html#schoolbook-fonts">Japanese schoolbook
  fonts</a> The formats of the kanji are those of Japan rather than
  China, thus the stroke shapes and the stroke order follow the
  Japanese example in all cases. Please see <a href="ref.html">our
  reference page</a> for exact details of the fonts and other
  references used as models.
</p>
<p>
  Since the data was made public around 2008, some additions have been
  made to the data, such that it now extends to a few characters which
  do not belong to the level one or two JIS standards. However, all
  the additions still follow Japanese standards.
</p>
<p>
  Other open source projects exist which cover traditional
  (Taiwan/Hong Kong) and simplified (mainland China and Singapore)
  Chinese characters. Please see the "related projects" link at the
  left of this page.
</p>

<h2>Format</h2>

<p>
  The KanjiVG file format is an extension
  of <a href="glossary.html#svg">SVG</a>. All KanjiVG files are 100%
  SVG-compliant, and can be opened by any SVG viewer or editor
  as-is. The shape of each kanji stroke (an individual line) is
  described as an
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData">SVG path</a>
  on an area of size 109x109 pixels. Since these are vector graphics,
  they can be rescaled at will to any convenient size.
</p>

<p>
  The SVG file is organized to reflect both the structure
  and <a href="stroke-order">stroke order</a> of the kanji.
  Furthermore, several additional attributes provide extra information
  about the kanji's structure. See <a href="svg-format.html">SVG
  Format</a> for details.
</p>

<h2>Character models</h2>

<p>
  The main graphical data is is based on schoolbook fonts
  (<nobr><ruby>教科書体<rt>きょうかしょたい</rt></ruby></nobr>), which
  is a variation of the calligraphic kaisho style 

  (<nobr><ruby>楷書<rt>かいしょ</rt></ruby></nobr>). The exact fonts
  used as models for the KanjiVG graphical data are listed on
  the <a href="ref.html">References</a> page.
</p>

<p>
  There is data for variations of characters and stroke order. When
  characters in schoolbook style deviate from traditional kaisho,
  there might be an extra version for kaisho, labelled with the
  suffix <code>-Kaisho</code>. There are also different versions for
  different stroke orders. See <a href="variants.html">Variants</a>
  for more information on the file naming and what variants exist.
</p>

<h2>Individual kanji files</h2>

<p>
In the repository for KanjiVG, each kanji has at least one file which
is given a name of the lower-case hexadecimal Unicode value of the
kanji, padded to five characters with zeros, followed by the
suffix <code>.svg</code>. 
</p>

<h2>Download files</h2>

<p>
The download XML files are created from the individual kanji files,
excluding the variant forms. The Python scripts to create the files
are in the repository.
