  <h1>KanjiVG files</h1>
</div>

<p>
  The KanjiVG file format is an extension of SVG. All KanjiVG files
  are 100% SVG-compliant, and can be opened by any SVG viewer or
  editor as-is. The shape of each kanji stroke (an individual line) is
  described as an
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData">SVG path</a>
  on an area of size 109x109 pixels. Since these are vector graphics,
  they can be rescaled at will to any convenient size.
</p>

<p>
  The SVG file is organized to reflect both the structure and stroke
  order of the kanji.  Furthermore, several additional attributes
  provide extra information about the kanji's
  structure. See <a href="svg-format.html">SVG Format</a> for details.
</p>

<h2>Character models</h2>

<p>
  The main graphical data is is based on schoolbook fonts
  (<nobr><ruby>教科書体<rt>きょうかしょたい</rt></ruby></nobr>), which
  is a variation of the calligraphic kaisho style 

  (<nobr><ruby>楷書<rt>かいしょ</rt></ruby></nobr>). The exact fonts
  used as models for the KanjiVG graphical data are listed on
  the <a href="ref.html">References</a> page.
</p>

<p>
  There is data for variations of characters and stroke order. When
  characters in schoolbook style deviate from traditional kaisho,
  there might be an extra version for kaisho, labelled with the
  suffix <code>-Kaisho</code>. There are also different versions for
  different stroke orders. See <a href="variants.html">Variants</a>
  for more information on the file naming and what variants exist.
