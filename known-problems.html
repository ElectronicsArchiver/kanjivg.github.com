<h2>Duplicate files</h2>

<p>
The following files were duplicated during the creation of the KanjiVG files.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
0514e-Hyougai.svg and 0514e-Jinmei.svg are essentially the same
variant, but with slightly different stroke positions.
</li>
<li>
07149-Jinmei.svg is an unnecessary duplicate of 07149.svg with
slightly different stroke positions.
</li>
</ul>
