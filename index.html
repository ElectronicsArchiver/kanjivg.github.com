<p>
    KanjiVG is a description of the sinographs (or kanji) used by the Japanese language. For each character, it provides
    a SVG file that gives the shape, direction and of each of its strokes. This file is also enriched with exhaustive
    information about the components of the character, the type of stroke employed, etc. See
    <a href="format.html">Format</a> for detailed information.
</p>

<p>
    Using KanjiVG, it is very easy to create stroke order diagrams or animations, kanji dictionaries, and many more.
</p>

<h2>Using</h2>

<p>
    First, you may want to understand the <a href="format.html">format</a> of the file.
</p>

<h2>Reporting errors</h2>

<p>
    Although a huge amount of work has been invested into making KanjiVG error-free, there are probably many errors
    remaining in the data. We would really appreciate if you could report them to us. Normally, telling us the kanji
    where the error resides is sufficient for us to fix it.
