<p>
  KanjiVG (Kanji Vector Graphics) provides vector graphics and other
  information about the sinographs (kanji) used by the Japanese
  language. For each character, it provides an SVG (Scalable Vector
  Graphics) file which gives the shape and direction of its strokes,
  as well as the stroke order. Each file is also enriched with
  information about the components of the character such as the
  radical, or the type of stroke employed.
</p>

<p>
  It is very easy to create stroke order diagrams, animations, kanji
  dictionaries, and much more using
  KanjiVG. See <a href="projects.html">Projects using KanjiVG</a> for
  a growing list of applications of the KanjiVG data.
</p>

<h2>Using</h2>

<p>
  The KanjiVG diagrams are simply SVG files, and may be viewed in any
  web browser or other SVG viewer.  See the links at the left under
  "Format" for details of the file internals.
