<p>
  This glossary consistently uses the word <i>kanji</i> to indicate
  sinographs, Chinese characters, hanzi, and so forth.
</p>

<!-- Alphabetical order -->

<h2>CJK Unified Ideographs</h2>

<p>
  A block of Unicode containing kanji. The basic block goes from
  U+4E00 to U+9FFF, but it was extended with CJK Unified Ideographs
  Extension A from U+3400 to U+4DBF.
</p>

<h2>CJK Strokes</h2>

<p>
  A block of Unicode containing kanji stroke shapes.
</p>

<h2>CJK Radicals</h2>

<p>
  A block of Unicode containing kanji radicals.
</p>

<h2>Han Unification</h2>

<p>
  Part of the original effort of Unicode to fit as many characters as
  possible into sixteen bits by using the same code point for characters
  considered to be identical. These characters are often graphically
  different, thus the Japanese-style KanjiVG vector graphics for various
  Unicode code points are not appropriate for Chinese usage.
</p>

<h2>JIS Level One and Two</h2>

<p>
  <ruby>第1・第2水準漢字<rt>だいいち・だいにすいじゅんかんじ</rt></ruby>

  Two sets of kanji which were used as the basis for the coverage of
  KanjiVG.
</p>

<p>
  These sets were the standard sets of kanji available on
  Japanese-language computing platforms before the advent of Unicode.
</p>

<h2 id='kangxi'>Kangxi radicals</h2>

<p>
  The historical radical system of an old Chinese dictionary. These
  radicals are labelled <code>general</code> or <code>tradit</code> in
  KanjiVG, in contrast with the <a href="#nelson-radicals">Nelson
    radicals</a>.
</p>

<h2 id='kangxi-radicals-block'>Kangxi Radicals Block</h2>

<p>
  A block of Unicode containing the canonical form of the
  214 <a href="#kangxi">Kangxi radicals</a>.
</p>


<h2 id='nelson-radicals'>Nelson radicals</h2>

<p>
  The altered radicals used in the <a href="ref.html#nelson">Nelson
    kanji dictionary</a>. Nelson used a more systematic approach to
  recategorise kanji into radicals, resulting in different values than
  the <a href="kangxi-radicals">Kangxi radical system</a>.
