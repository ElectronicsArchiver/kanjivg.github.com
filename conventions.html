  <h1>Conventions of KanjiVG</h1>
</div>

<p>
  This page details some choices made by KanjiVG. If you wish to discuss
  changing the individual choices, please use the mailing list (see the
  link on the left) to bring up your proposal.
</p>

<h2>Radicals used</h2>

<p>
  This section details the choices made for the values of
  <a href="format.html#element"><code>kvg:element</code></a>, the visual
  representation of a kanji radical.

  <h3>
    Sanzui
  </h3>

<p>
  The radical used for <span class='romaji'>sanzui</span> elements
  (the variant form of Kangxi radical 85, "water") is U+6C35 氵 rather
  than U+2EA1 ⺡, except for the special case of U+2EA1 itself.
</p>

<h3>
  Kemono-hen
</h3>

<p>
  The radical used for <span class='romaji'>kemono-hen</span> elements
  (the variant form of Kangxi radical 94, "dog") is U+2EA8 ⺨ rather
  than U+72AD 犭, except for the special case of U+72AD itself.
</p>

<h3>
  Shin-nyō
</h3>

<p>
  The radical used for <span class='romaji'>shin-nyō</span> elements
  (Kangxi radical 162, "walk") is either U+8FB6 辶 or U+2ECC ⻌
  depending on whether the radical consists of four or three elements
  respectively. Confusingly, the visual display of U+8FB6 in a font
  may appear to contain only three strokes.
</p>
<p>
  The visually highly similar U+2ECD, from CJK Radicals Supplement,
  and U+FA66, from CJK Compatibility Ideographs, are not used by
  KanjiVG.
</p>

<h3>
  Other radicals
</h3>

<p>
  For all of the non-variant radicals, two equivalent forms exist, one
  in the Kangxi Radicals block of Unicode from U+2F00 to U+2FD5, and
  another in the CJK Unified Ideograph block of Unicode. KanjiVG uses
  only the CJK Unified Ideograph versions of these equivalent entries,
  and does not use the Kangxi Radicals block at all. This seems to be
  because the KanjiVG project dates back to the early 2000s, when font
  support for Unicode was more limited than today.
</p>

<p>
  However, KanjiVG does use some parts of the CJK Radicals Supplement
  block from U+2E80 to U+2EF3, for example U+2E97 ⺗ is used for
  the <span class='romaji'>shitagokoro</span> variant of Kangxi
  radical 61, rather than the CJK Unified Ideographs equivalent form
  U+38FA 㣺. These choices seem to have been made in an arbitrary
  fashion.
</p>
<p>
In the following table, the pink colour shows which variant was used
for various radicals. Here the number is the Kangxi radical number,
and the name is the romanised Japanese name of the radical.
