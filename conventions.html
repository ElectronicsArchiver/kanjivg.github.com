  <h1>Conventions of KanjiVG</h1>
</div>

<p>
This page details some choices made by KanjiVG. If you wish to discuss
changing the individual choices, please use the mailing list at Google
Groups to bring up your proposal.
</p>

<h2>Radicals used</h2>

<p>
This section details the choices made for the values of
<a href="format.html#element"><code>kvg:element</code></a>, the visual
representation of a kanji radical.

<h3>
  Sanzui
</h3>

<p>
  The radical used for sanzui elements (the variant form of Kangxi radical 85,
  "water") is U+6C35 氵 rather than U+2EA1 ⺡, except for the special
  case of U+2EA1 itself.
</p>

<h3>
  Kemono-hen
</h3>

<p>
  The radical used for kemono-hen elements (the variant form of Kangxi
  radical 94, "dog") is U+2EA8 ⺨ rather than U+72AD 犭, except for
  the special case of U+72AD itself.
</p>

<h3>
  Shin-nyō
</h3>

<p>
  The radical used for shin-nyō elements (Kangxi radical 162, "walk")
  is either U+8FB6 辶 or U+2ECC ⻌ depending on whether the radical
  consists of four or three elements respectively. Confusingly, the
  visual display of 8FB6 in a font may appear to contain only three
  strokes.
</p>
<p>
  The visually highly similar U+2ECD from CJK Radicals Supplement, and
  U+FA66 from CJK Compatibility Ideograph are not used by KanjiVG.
