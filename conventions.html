  <h1>Conventions of KanjiVG</h1>
</div>

<p>
  This page details some choices made by KanjiVG. If you wish to discuss
  changing the individual choices, please use the mailing list (see the
  link on the left) to bring up your proposal.
</p>

<h2>Radicals used</h2>

<p>
  This section details the choices made for the values of
  <a href="format.html#element"><code>kvg:element</code></a>, the visual
  representation of a kanji radical.

  <h3>
    Sanzui
  </h3>

<p>
  The radical used for <span class='romaji'>sanzui</span> elements
  (the variant form of Kangxi radical 85, "water") is U+6C35 氵 rather
  than U+2EA1 ⺡, except for the special case of U+2EA1 itself.
</p>

<h3>
  Kemono-hen
</h3>

<p>
  The radical used for <span class='romaji'>kemono-hen</span> elements
  (the variant form of Kangxi radical 94, "dog") is U+2EA8 ⺨ rather
  than U+72AD 犭, except for the special case of U+72AD itself.
</p>

<h3>
  Shin-nyō
</h3>

<p>
  The radical used for <span class='romaji'>shin-nyō</span> elements
  (Kangxi radical 162, "walk") is either U+8FB6 辶 or U+2ECC ⻌
  depending on whether the radical consists of four or three elements
  respectively. (Confusingly, the visual display of U+8FB6 in a font
  may appear to contain only three strokes.)
</p>
<p>
  The visually highly similar U+2ECD, from CJK Radicals Supplement,
  and U+FA66, from CJK Compatibility Ideographs, are not used by
  KanjiVG.
</p>

<h3>
Shoku-hen
</h3>

<p>
飠 U+98E0 from CJK Unified Ideographs is used for the eight-stroke
variant of <span class='romaji'>shoku-hen</span>, but ⻞ U+2EDE from
CJK Radicals Supplement is used for the nine-stroke variant, since
there does not seem to be a visually-close equivalent in CJK Unified
Ideographs.
</p>

<h3>
  Other radicals
</h3>

<p>
  For all of the non-variant radical forms, there are two equivalent
Unicode code points with the same visual form. One is in the Kangxi
Radicals block of Unicode, from U+2F00 to U+2FD5, and the other is in
the CJK Unified Ideograph block of Unicode. The equivalence between
these is given in the Unicode Character Database (UCD) in the
file <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/CJKRadicals.txt">CJKRadicals.txt</a>,
which maps between the pairs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>KanjiVG uses only the CJK Unified Ideograph versions of these
equivalent entries.</strong> KanjiVG does not use the Kangxi Radicals
block at all.
</p>

<p>
  However, KanjiVG does use some parts of the CJK Radicals Supplement
  block from U+2E80 to U+2EF3, for example U+2E97 ⺗ is used for
  the <span class='romaji'>shitagokoro</span> variant of Kangxi
  radical 61, rather than the CJK Unified Ideographs equivalent form
  U+38FA 㣺.
</p>
<p>
In the following table, the pink colour shows which variant was used
for various radicals. Here the number is the Kangxi radical number,
and the name is the romanised Japanese name of the radical.

      U+722B does not form part of the JIS Level one and two kanji
      standards, so it was never an element of KanjiVG, hence unlike
      <span class='romaji'>sanzui</span>
      and <span class='romaji'>kemono-hen</span> there is no
      "self-exception" for this character.
